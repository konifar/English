# The garden of word

Until I enter the high school two months ago, I thought I... I didn't know anything.

When I was a little, the sky was closer, so much closer.

Chocolate and beer... Seems familier then... Ah!

Here.

Oh, Thank you.

Have... I'm sorry but have we met before?

...? No.

Right. Yeah, of course. My mistake.

It's ok.

Ah...! Have met us.

I'm home.

Oh hey. 

I bought croquettes.

Cool. The dinner is almost ready.

Thanks you. Where is mom?

Where now.

More for us? Did she say anything?

Just said no. Don't come looking for me. So maybe we should.

So I found place and move next month.

With her?

She is ready, I'm ready.

That's why mom left.

She looks younger for age.

I supporse so.

Hey have you heard this?

Hmm, what is this Haiku?

I's a Tanka.



I broght breakfast.

Thank you so much.
It's my pleasure.

Beach bash.

I worked whole time.

Whole time?


Do you...know them?


It might be...

The happiest...

Time of my life.

I love you.

Not Yukino. Miss Yukino.

Thank you for your hospitality.
