# The garden of word

Until I enter the high school two months ago, I thought I... I don't know anything.

When I was a little, sky is closer, so much closer.


Have... Sorry but have we met before?

No.

My mistake.

I broght breakfast.

Thank you so much.
It's my pleasure.


Akiduki!

Beach bash.

I worked whole time.

Whole time?


Do you...know them?


It might be...

The happiest...

Time of my life.

I love you.

Yukino,

Not Yukino. Miss Yukino.

Thank you for your hospitality.
